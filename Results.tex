\section{Results}

We were able to create a database scheme, included in the appendix, to hold the data in an easily filtered form. Additionally a parser that reads one log-file into a database following the scheme that has been written in Java. 
The database schema and parser have been confirmed functional with the 4.7 MB log-file we received from Cybercom and an off-site database. The filtering and searching functions simplify the work with the data gathered in the log-file for a future development of the project. The intended future development would be a graphical program that visualises the data which would farther improve the understanding of what this data signifies. 

Below we present a test string from the log-file which the script inserts into the database:

\begin{verbatim}
{ "itemId": "103636965585520737", "stationId": "1", "appId": "123",
"typeId": "OSCAR_BLACKBOARD_TYPE_VEHICLE_STATUS", "location": { "latitude":
52.5228688988356, "longitude": 13.410204655793073 }, "locationConfidence": 1, 
"validityDuration": 1.5, "validityArea": "NaN", "blackboardProperties": [{"type": 
"OSCAR_BLACKBOARD_PROPERTY_ACCELERATION", "acceleration": 0 }, {
"type": "OSCAR_BLACKBOARD_PROPERTY_SPEED", "speed": 10 }, { "type": "OSCAR
_BLACKBOARD_PROPERTY_YAW_RATE", "yawRate": 0 } ] }}

\end{verbatim}
