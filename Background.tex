\section{Background}
The background for this project is to create safer travelling systems for all actors on the market. By bike, by feet or by car does not matter since the vision is that 0 casualties should occur in a traffic accident.\bigskip

Therefore a system that communicates with cars, infrastructures or other vehicles to lower the percentage of fatal accidents are very sought after, and vehicle manufacturers have been developing this technology for a long time the problem they have now are latency since the existing system depends on a cloud service which has too long latency in some situations where a microsecond could make a big difference.
