\section{Background}
The background for this project is that a safer travelling system is wanted for all actors on the market. By bike, by feet or by car does not matter since the vision is that 0 persons should die in a traffic accident.
\bigskip

Therefore a system that communicates with cars, infrastructures or other vehicles to lower the percentage of fatal accidents are very sought after, and vehicle manufacturers have been developing this technology for a long time the problem they have now are latency since the existing system depends on a cloud service which has too long latency in some situations where a microsecond could make a big difference.
