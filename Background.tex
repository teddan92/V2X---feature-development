\section{Background}
This project will be a pilot-study for future work because the time that we have will not be enough to finish the implementation. The V2V system present today has very high latency and will not be as precise when travelling through a cloud. Therefore many car manufacturers want to create an even better system for a safer way of travel.
\paragraph{}
Cybercom, which is the company that we are doing this for, is a consultant company that has other partners who develop the V2V feature of V2X. Cybercom wants to help these companies by testing if there are other parts in a traffic situation where this type of communication can come in hand.
They have therefore sent out this project for Chalmers University of Technology to investigate if there are other ways this system can be implemented for a safer travel for everyone who travels on land.
