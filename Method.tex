To start the project a shared repository was created in Google Drive to make the work flow more effective between all group members. It was decided that the group would have a minimum of two meetings a week, at the beginning and end of each week to review and discuss the work done so far along with planning goals and tasks for the upcoming week. At the end of each week, the group would try to have a meeting with the supervisor at Cybercom (Jens), where he would review the  progress of the project , answer questions from the group members and give advise or help with the program software.

\textit{Slack} was used as a professional source of communication between all group members and so far it has made the daily internal  group contact simple and efficient. To organise the work and distribute the workload in a clear way between group members the application named \textit{Trello}  was used with an influence of the \textit{Scrum} method to administrate work flow and  solve the tasks. 
The group decided on  a specific case scenario to solve and with the help of Scrum the case was broken down into smaller tasks. In \textit{Trello} the case scenario was documented together with the user cases in a backlog, and from there these user cases were divided into smaller more concrete problems to solve. For each week the group decided on a few tasks which would be distributed between all group members, and at the beginning of the next upcoming week the potential results would be discussed between group members and unresolved problems would be brought up to try and reach a solution together.  Other questions and problems were directed to the Chalmers supervisor (Sakib), who through the project  helped with the way to plan, and organise the project to be able to complete in time
