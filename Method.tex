The administration of the project was composed of a conjoint Google Drive storage sharing, Trello application for task planning and management together with the application Slack for all the communication.

It was decided that the group would have a minimum of two meetings a week, at the beginning and end of each week, to review and discuss the work done so far along with planning goals and tasks for the upcoming week. At the end of each week, the group would try to have a meeting with the supervisor at Cybercom, where he would review the progress of the project, answer questions from the group members and give advise or help with the program software. Other project related questions and problems were directed to the Chalmers' supervisor, who has been helping with the way to plan and organise the project for us to be able to complete it in time.

Before getting access to anything from the company all group members signed a standard non-disclosure agreement because the software that was going to be handed out to potentially be worked with contained confidential information. The group members also got access to the company's Github account with relevant information about the project. We received a log file with annexed documentation, to be parsed.

The group decided on a specific case scenario to solve and with the help of Scrum the case was broken down into smaller, more feasible tasks. 

Our original method to test our V2X scenario was supposed to use the software supplied by Cybercom, but after some weeks we had to rethink our plans. The new strategy was to create a database with which to parse the information we acquired from the pseudo-log file with the purpose to map the locations of the two entities registered in the file and study the gathered data at each point.
