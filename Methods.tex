The project was started by creating a common database to make working together easier for all group members. It was decided that the group would have a minimum of two meetings a week, at the beginning and end of each week to review and discuss the work done so far and to put up goals/ tasks for the upcoming week. At the end of each week, the group would have a meeting with the supervisor at Cybercom, where he would check how the project is going, answer questions from the group members and give advise or help with the program software. Slack was used as a professional source of communication between all group members and so far it has made internal daily group contact simple and efficient. To organise the work and distribute the workload in a clear way between group members the Trello application was used with an influence of the Scrum method to solve the tasks. The group decided on  a specific case scenario to solve and with the help of Scrum the scenario was broken down into smaller tasks. In Trello the case scenario was documented together with the user cases in a backlog, and from there these user cases were divided  into smaller more concrete problems to solve. For each week up until now the group decided on a few tasks which would be distributed between  all group members with \textit{avseende på} workload,  and time required to solve.
